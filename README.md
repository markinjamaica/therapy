## About

My plan with this website is for it to be useful to those that struggle with negative emotions (most of us). I wanted to give people a resource where they can quickly reference scriptures that can help them with their specific needs.

The primary section of this web application is the "Challenges" section. I created a list of a number of different challenging feelings that we as human beings face on a daily basis. Each topic features practical advice from the Bible to help users gain a greater degree of control over their thoughts, and subsequently, their feelings. Along with each piece of advice is a scriptural reference, so that users can see that the advice does not have me as its source, but rather it is based on wisdom from our Creator. Also, each piece of advice includes the citation for the scripture, as well as an option to add the advice to a users personal goals.

It features a section where upon logging in users can also create their own goals to help them work on their emotional health issues. People can either select a goal to add from a list of helpful advice in the "challenges" section, or they can create their goal from scratch.

There is also a scripture look up page, where users can choose from a variety of different Bible translations. The Bible feature makes use of an API to fetch all the data.
