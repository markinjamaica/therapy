        <h2>How can we learn to control our thoughts?</h2>
        <p class="content">When we don't like what is playing on tv, we don't keep sitting there hoping it will get better 
            -instead, we just change the channel. Likewise, rather that continuing to think the same harmful thoughts which cause us to feel bad, 
            we can "change the channel" by replacing our harmful thoughts with positive ones. As a result, we will begin to feel better.</p>
        <p class="content"><strong>The following steps can help us replace harmful thoughts with positive ones:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify</strong> the harmful thoughts. <em>Example: "I always mess things up. I am worthless."</em></li>
            <li>Try to <strong>correct</strong> the harmful thought by reasoning on it. 
                <em>Example: "Everyone makes their share of mistakes. Besides, Jehovah doesn't think I am worthless. In fact, he sent his precious son to die for me!"</em>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dismiss</strong> the toxic thought. Reject it as the lie that it is.</li>
            <li><strong>Get busy</strong>. Get immersed in something positive. Change the channel so to speak.</li>
        </ol>
