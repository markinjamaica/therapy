<p>How can we overcome harmful emotions?</p>
<p>Since our feelings primarily stem from our thoughts, we need to learn to control our thinking.</p>
<blockquote>We are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.</blockquote>
<cite>- 2 Corinthians 10:5</cite>
<p>Identify, Correct, Dismiss, Get Busy</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identify the harmful thoughts. <span>Example: "I am worthless</span></li>
    <li>Try to correct the harmful thought by reasoning on it.<span>Example: "I am not worthless! God sent his Son to die for me!</span></li>
    <li>Dismiss the toxic thought. Reject it as the lie that it is.</li>
    <li>Get busy. Get immersed in something positive.</li>
</ol>
